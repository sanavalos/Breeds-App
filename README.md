# Welcome to "Breeds App"

This app will provide all what you need about dog breeds.

## How does it work?

Once you enter the app, you will see a landing page and a button that redirects you to home page. <br/>
From there you will be able to search dog breeds by name using the search bar, sort by name, weight and/or filter by temperament, creation (API, DB). <br/>
Once you make your choices, 8 different dog breeds will be display in card format per page and if you are interested you can click their image to learn more details about it. <br/>
You can also add them to favorites, in case a breed caughts your attention.<br/>
If you are not happy with your search you can always reset the app using the button located in the same sidebar as the sorts and filters.<br/>
Another feature is the creation of a breed through a form that must be completed with a name, temperamnt, life span, weight, height and image(from browser).<br/>
